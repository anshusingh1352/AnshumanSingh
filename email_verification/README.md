# User Login with Email & OTP

Starting with the basic details of the project that is it contains
3 pages login where user can enter his email id, second is OTP page
where he/she can check that the otp is correct or not. and the third one is
Dashboard. in Dashboard i have used session so if i person directly
want to access Dashboard he/she will be redirect to the index page i.e our login page
,similiary for other pages the whole application is created on Django framework
with basic HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT, to sent a mail to the user 
i have created a stmp script which sents the email with to the user
whoes email id is entered in the starting of the application.

to sent the mail i have used my dummy email that is free for me so the application
does not take any cost for using it.
